## C++ Solutions

The C++ solutions can be found in the `C++` folder. Each problem has its own separate file, named after the problem's title, and contains the C++ code for the solution. The files are structured in a modular way, making it easy to understand and reuse the code. The solutions are well-commented, providing explanations for the approach taken and any relevant algorithmic insights. The code is also optimized for efficiency and readability.

## Java Solutions

The Java solutions can be found in the `Java` folder. Similar to the C++ solutions, each problem has its own file named after the problem's title. The Java code follows best practices and adheres to object-oriented programming principles. The solutions are written in a concise and clear manner, with detailed comments explaining the logic behind the approach. The code is designed to be easily understandable and maintainable.

## JavaScript Solutions

The JavaScript solutions can be found in the `JavaScript` folder. Each problem is implemented in a separate file, and the file name corresponds to the problem's title. The solutions utilize JavaScript's flexibility and built-in functions to provide efficient and concise code. The solutions are thoroughly commented, providing insights into the thought process and algorithmic choices. The JavaScript code follows industry best practices and maintains code readability.

## MySQL Solutions

The MySQL solutions can be found in the `Database` folder. Each problem's solution is stored in a separate file, named after the problem's title. The SQL queries are well-structured, optimized, and adhere to standard SQL conventions. The solutions include detailed comments explaining the logic and the step-by-step approach used to solve the problem. Additionally, the queries are designed to handle large datasets efficiently, focusing on both accuracy and performance.
